# 🎂 Birthday Greeter

This is a small Python project I built while learning about functions and 
user input.  
It’s a simple program that asks for your name and age, then prints a short 
birthday message with a bit of timing to make it feel more personal.

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to create and use functions in Python  
- How to collect user input using `input()`  
- How to format text using **f-strings**  
- How to use `time.sleep()` to pause between lines  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The program asks for your name and age.  
2. It passes those values into a function called `birthday_greeter()`.  
3. The function prints a birthday message step by step with short pauses.

## 🖥️ Example Output

- Enter your name: Bernard
- Enter your age: 30
- Happy birthday to you Bernard
- You are 30 years old
- Welcome to a new age, have an amazing year ahead

## 🧠 Future Plans
I’ll keep improving this as I learn more — maybe add emojis, colors, or 
even random birthday quotes next.
