# 🧑‍💻 Python Login System

A simple **Python-based login system** that demonstrates the use of 
functions, membership operators, and conditional logic to handle user 
authentication.  
This was built as part of my **Core Python learning journey** before 
moving into AI and automation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Checks if a user is allowed or blocked  
- 🔁 Loops for multiple login attempts  
- ⏱️ Displays login time using the `time` module  
- 💬 Provides clear feedback to users  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use **membership operators** (`in`, `not in`)  
- How to organize code using **functions**  
- The difference between **allowed** and **blocked** users using lists and 
sets  
- How to **import modules** (`time`)  
- Structuring small projects with clean, readable code

## 🧩 Example Output

```bash
Enter your name: Michael
Access Granted! Welcome Michael✅
Login time: 11:45:22
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Built-in modules (time)

## 🧠 Future Plans

I’ll keep improving this project as I learn more.  
Here are some ideas I’d love to add next:

- 🎨 Add color and emoji styling for better console UI  
- 🔐 Include password authentication for each user  
- 🗂️ Store user data in a JSON or text file for persistence  
- 📊 Track login history and failed attempts automatically  
- 🗓️ Add a "birthday reminder" or random motivational quotes feature  
- 🧰 Convert it into a simple desktop or web-based login system
