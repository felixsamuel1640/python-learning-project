# 🎓 Student Grade Lookup Database

A small Python console app that lets you **check, add, and view student 
grades** from a simple in-memory database.

This project helped me practice:
- Functions and loops  
- Conditionals and user input  
- Using dictionaries to store data  
- Working with `time.sleep()` for realistic feedback

## 🚀 Features

- **Check a student's grade** by entering their name.  
- **Add new students** and assign them grades.  
- **View all student records** in the database.  
- **Exit the program** safely when done.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project taught me how to:
- Build interactive programs using `input()`  
- Update and read data from a dictionary  
- Use `if/elif` logic to control program flow  
- Keep a program running until the user exits

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.  
2. Save the file as `student_database.py`.  
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   python student_database.py

4. Follow the on-screen menu to explore the database

## 💡 Future Improvements

• Add the ability to save and load student data from a file.
• Include grade validation to ensure only valid letters (A–F).
• Display grades in a sorted list (e.g., highest to lowest).
